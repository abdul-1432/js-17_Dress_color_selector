## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the fashion color selector in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-color-selector.git](https://github.com/abdul-1432/js-17_Dress_color_selector)
   ```

2. Copy the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to your project directory.

### Usage

To add the fashion color selector to your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/fashion-color-selector.css">
   <script src="path/to/fashion-color-selector.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a container element for the color selector:

   ```HTML
   <div id="color-selector">
     <!-- Color options go here -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Customize the color options and styling by modifying the HTML and CSS files, or by adding your own styles.

4. Initialize the fashion color selector by calling the `initColorSelector()` function:

   ```javascript
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
       initColorSelector();
     });
   </script>
   ```

   The `initColorSelector()` function will add interactivity to the color options and handle any necessary functionality, such as updating the selected color.
